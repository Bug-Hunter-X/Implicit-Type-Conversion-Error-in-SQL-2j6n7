This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon SQL bug related to implicit type conversion.  The bug occurs when a string containing non-numeric characters is implicitly converted to a numeric type within an SQL function or expression. This can lead to incorrect results or errors, depending on the database system's behavior. The solution demonstrates a more robust approach that handles potential type conversion issues and prevents unexpected behavior.
