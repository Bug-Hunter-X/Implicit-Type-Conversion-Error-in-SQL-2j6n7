The solution uses explicit type checking and conversion to handle potential errors.  It uses CASE statements to check if the string can be successfully cast to a numeric type before performing the conversion.  If the cast fails, it handles the error gracefully, perhaps by returning a default value or logging the issue.  This ensures data integrity and prevents unexpected errors.
